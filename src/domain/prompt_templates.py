    First Example:

    History conversation
    None

    Incoming human input
    Aku lagi nyari apartement di jakarta nih yang deket PT Khong guan harganya dibawah 5jtan

    Extracted Data:
    building_title: null
    building_address: "Jakarta"
    building_proximity: "PT Khong guan"
    building_facility: null
    building_note: null
    filter_type: "LESS_THAN"
    less_than_price: 5000000
    greater_than_price: null

    Explanation:
    1. The human wanted an apartment in any Jakarta region that has nearby PT Khong guan building with rent price that less than 5000000

    Second Example Conversation:

    History conversation
    Human = Aku lagi nyari apartement di jakarta nih yang harganya diatas 5jtan
    AI = Kalau ini gimana kak? ini harga diatas 5 juta (showing the list of apartments)

    Incoming human input
    Kak gajadi deh kayanya yang di bandung deket gedung sate aja deh, yang ada parkiran dalam dan dapur bersama ya, trus khusus perempuan

    Extracted Data:
    building_title: null
    building_address: "Bandung"
    building_proximity: "gedung sate"
    building_facility: "parkiran dalam, dapur bersama"
    building_note: "perempuan" Some notes that the prompter asked
    filter_type: "GREATER_THAN"
    less_than_price: null
    greater_than_price: 5000000

    Explanation:
    1. Initially the human wanted an apartment in any Jakarta region, with rent price that less than 5000000.
    2. But after the AI gave the human the list of apartments, the human has a sudden change in mind that he wanted an apartment in any Bandung region that has nearby Gedung sate building
    3. Has "parkiran dalam" and "dapur bersama" which we put in "building_facility" property because it's a facility
    4. And the human also asked for specific rule of the apartment that allow only woman to rent the apartment, because of this we put the value in "building_note" property
    5. The human also change The rent price requirement to be greater than 5000000

    Third Example Conversation

    History conversation
    Human = Aku lagi nyari apartement di gandsaria deket gancy nih
    AI = Maksudnya gandaria ya kak?
    Human = Iya kak gandaria, yang harganya 2.5 - 5jtan dong, adakah?
    AI = Kalau ini gimana kak? ini deket gancy (showing the list of apartments)

    Incoming human input
    Kurang kak, mau pake kamar mandi dalam sama AC ya, trus kalo bisa bulanan dan boleh bawa hewan kucing

    Extracted Data:
    building_title: null
    building_address: "gandaria"
    building_proximity: "gancy"
    building_facility: "kamar mandi dalam, Air Conditioner, AC"
    building_note: "bulanan, boleh bawa hewan, boleh bawa kucing"
    filter_type: "AROUND"
    less_than_price: 5000000
    greater_than_price: 2500000

    Explanation:
    1. We can see the human seems to have typo in the writting as we can see that he wrote gandsaria instead of gandaria, so you need to be careful of those kind of typo
    2. Then he also asked for the building with gancy or Gandaria city in its proximity, remind that gancy is not a type so once again you need to be careful of those kind of things
    3. Now that you know the area is Gandaria, we can assume that the human wanted an apartment in Gandaria area, with Gancy as its proximity,
    4. With the rent price ranging between less than 5000000 but greater than 2500000, making the value of "filter_type" to be "AROUND".
    5. But after the AI gave the human the list of apartments, he suddenly change his mind that he wanted an apartment with more facility to be noted
    6. The human wants an apartment that has "kamar mandi dalam, Air Conditioner, and AC" which we put in "building_facility" property because it's a facility, you also need to watch the facility abbrevation aswell, if applicable
    7. And the human also asked for specific rule of the apartment that allow the tenant to bring any kind of pets and specifically for "kucing", the human also noting the rules of how tenant pay rent, in this case the rent payment that he want is monthly, because of this we put those value in "building_note" property

    Explanation:
    1. Initially the human wanted a kosan or boarding houses in Palmerah area, that has the price ranging around 2000000
    2. The user implied to give a price range that in this case is "2jtan" or 2 jutaan or around 2 million, making the filter_type to be "AROUND" and following the rules above, the value of less_than_price and greater_than_price need to be adjusted
    3. After the AI shows the list of kosans, the human add more requirement to the AI that he also wanted a kosan that has "kamar mandi dalam, Air Conditioner, and AC" which we put in "building_facility"
