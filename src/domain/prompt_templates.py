    First Example Conversation:
    System = "Conversation Begin"
    Human = "Aku lagi nyari apartement di jakarta nih yang deket PT Khong guan harganya dibawah 5jtan"

    Extracted Data:
    building_title: null

    building_facility: null
    building_note: null
    filter_type: "LESS_THAN"
    less_than_price: 5000000
    greater_than_price: null
    
    Second Example Conversation:
    System = "Conversation Begin"
    Human = "Aku lagi nyari apartement di jakarta nih yang harganya diatas 5jtan"
    AI = "Aku cariin dulu ya kak"
    Human = "Kak gajadi deh kayanya yang di bandung deket gedung sate aja deh, yang ada parkiran dalam dan dapur bersama ya, trus khusus perempuan"

    building_address: "Bandung"
    building_proximity: "gedung sate"
    building_facility: "parkiran dalam, dapur bersama" # this mean it has the facility and it applies for other benefit too
    building_note: "perempuan" # Some notes that the prompter asked
    filter_type: "GREATER_THAN"
    less_than_price: null
    greater_than_price: 5000000
    
    Third Example Conversation:
    System = "Conversation Begin"
    Human = "Aku lagi nyari apartement di gandsaria deket gancy nih"
    AI = "Maksudnya bandung ya kak?"
    Human = "Iya kak bandung, yang harganya 5jtan dong, adakah?"
    AI = "Aku cariin ya kak, duduk manis dulu aja wkwkkw"
    Human = "Eh kak budgetku cuman 4.5jt ada ga, tapi kamar mandi dalam sama AC ya, trus kalo bisa bulanan dan boleh bawa hewan kucing"

    Extracted Data:
    building_title: null
    building_address: "Gandaria"
    building_proximity: "gancy, gandaria"
    building_facility: "kamar mandi dalam, Air Conditioner, AC" # watch the facility abbrevation aswell, if applicable
    building_note: "bulanan, boleh bawa hewan, boleh bawa kucing" # Some notes that the prompter asked
    filter_type: "AROUND"
    less_than_price: 5500000
    greater_than_price: 4500000
    
    NOTE:
    - if you determine the filter type to be AROUND, make sure to range the price between
    greater_than_price: Rp.xxx - 10 percent 
    less_than_price: Rp.xxx + 10 percent
    - if the user ask for any price or "harganya bebas deh" or something like that
    set all filter to be None
    - if the user ask about gender for the note, extract in only 3 value between "Perempuan", "Lelaki", or "Campur"
    
    NOTE:
    ABOVE IS JUST EXAMPLE, UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT OF THE CONVERSATION HISTORY AND EXTRACT DATA BASED ON IT AND THE HUMAN INPUT

    You have done the searching for the object and still got 0 results.
    You found that the human prompt seems a bit funny which caused you to get 0 results from the search.
    
    Possible causes might be:
    - The address of the property
    - The price
    - The title

    Determine which of the above three is the possible cause.
    If one or more of the above three is the cause, please reask for the wrong details.

    For example:
    Human: coba cariin di bintario kak yang 1.5jtan 
    The possible cause: "bintario"
    Explanation: Possible typo, it should be "bintaro" but they gave "bintario".
    AI supposed to reply: Kita belum bisa nemuin yang dimaksud nih kak, maksudnya bintaro ya kak?

    Human: coba cariin di kebayoran kak yang murah 
    The possible cause: "murah"
    Explanation: The user isn't giving any details and went with "murah" as the price instead.
    AI supposed to reply: Kita belum bisa nemuin yang dimaksud nih kak, murahnya mau harga berapa kak, dibawah 1jt?

    Human: kak mau detail kosan yuken dong
    The possible cause: "ksan yuken"
    Explanation: Possible typo "ksan", as they meant to ask about "kosan".
    AI supposed to reply: Kita belum bisa nemuin yang dimaksud nih kak, maksudnya kosan yuken ya kak?

    Human: kak mau kosan di kebayoran dong harga 1.5jtan
    The possible cause: 0 search results 
    Explanation: There is no problem with the human prompt, but there is no such detail in the database, the result count is 0.
    AI supposed to reply: Kak kayanya ga ada deh yang kakak cari, mungkin bisa detailin lagi?

    Human: kak mau kosan di kebayoran dong harga 1.5jtan, ada kamar mandi dalam, kamarnya lega, dapur bersama kak ada?
    The possible cause: 0 search results
