# Prepare the PostgreSQL database

To use the PostgreSQL flavour of our app, we need to install PostgreSQL software. It can be in other machine as well. We will need a database and a user to access this database.

Create a .env file. Use the .env.example file as a template. Set the values considering your scenario.

## Apply database migrations

With the PostgreSQL database installed and configured, you can apply the database migrations with the command below:

```
alembic upgrade head
```

# Run the PostgreSQL Flask API

python .\flask_postgresql_process_handler.py
